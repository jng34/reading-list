# Reading List #

A simple, full stack application where the user can get information about each book, its author, and all the other books that the author has written.
This is made possible by using GraphQL Apollo on the frontend and GraphQL on the backend to query the necessary data. The user can also add more books by the specific author.

Tech stack: GraphQL, Apollo, React, Node.js, MongoDB
